# Oqtane Framework
Oqtane is a Modular Application Framework for Blazor

![Oqtane](https://github.com/oqtane/framework/blob/master/oqtane.png?raw=true "Oqtane")

Oqtane uses Blazor, a new web framework for .NET Core that lets you build interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript. Blazor apps are composed of reusable web UI components implemented using C#, HTML, and CSS. Both client and server code is written in C#, allowing you to share code and libraries.

Please note that this project is governed by the **[.NET Foundation Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://dotnetfoundation.org/code-of-conduct)**

**To get started with Oqtane:**

   1.&nbsp;Install **[.NET Core 3.2 SDK (v3.1.3)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1)**.
   
   2.&nbsp;Install the Preview edition of [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview/) (version 16.6 or higher) with the **ASP.NET and web development** workload. If you do not have a SQL Server installation available already and you wish to use LocalDB for development, you must also install the **.NET desktop development workload**.  

   3.&nbsp;Download or Clone the Oqtane source code to your local system. Open the **Oqtane.sln** solution file and Build the solution. 
   
   NOTE: If you have already installed a previous version of Oqtane and you wish to install a newer version, there is currently no upgrade path from one version to the next. The recommended upgrade approach is to get the latest code and build it, and then reset the DefaultConnection value to "" in the appsettings.json file in the Oqtane.server project. This will trigger a re-install when you run the application which will execute the latest database scripts.
   
   NOTE: If you want to submit pull requests make sure you install the [Github Extension For Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.github.com/). It is recommended you ignore any local changes you have made to the appsettings.json file before you submit a pull request. To automate this activity, open a command prompt and navigate to the /Oqtane.Server/ folder and enter the command "git update-index --skip-worktree appsettings.json" 

# Roadmap
This project is a work in progress and the schedule for implementing enhancements is dependent upon the availability of community members who are willing/able to assist.

Note: We are planning to release V1 at the same time that Blazor WebAssembly ships in May 2020

# Background
Oqtane was created by [Shaun Walker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaunbrucewalker/) and is inspired by the DotNetNuke web application framework. Initially created as a proof of concept, Oqtane is a native Blazor application written from the ground up using modern .NET Core technology. It is a modular application framework offering a fully dynamic page compositing model, multi-site support, designer friendly templates (skins), and extensibility via third party modules.
